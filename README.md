# WeekDay Scheduler

*Having trouble managing your workday? The **WeekDay Scheduler** can help!*


## About the App:

The WeekDay Scheduler was created as a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

*Missed that 1 p.m. call to your partner? Call them later! Or save it for tomorrow!*

By utilizing your device's local storage, events can be edited and saved for future use.

The application utilizes moment.js to audit any events every half hour and color codes them to represent if it's in the **past**, **present**, or **future**.

Need some zen? Clear your entire day with a simple click of a button!
